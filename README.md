===============

This is an example project for how to use the WoW web API. Its intent is to monitor 
the auction house and send alerts for high-margin deals.

Unfortunately, the Blizzard web API is not yet available for WoW Classic, 
and me, the author, will not develop this further until the Classic API is released.

To use this, set the environment variables `BLIZZ_API_CLIENT_ID` and `BLIZZ_API_CLIENT_SECRET`.
